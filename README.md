## **Dataset**

### &ensp;**Context**

- This dataset is a part of the published [Classification of Date Fruits in a Controlled Environment Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-69717-4_16) paper 

- A controlled environment was constructed to take pictures of the 9 different dates types acquired from Saudi Arabia. The imaging setup consists of a DSLR camera (canon EOS 550D), a digital single-lens reflex camera, with the flash enabled and a ring light with 48 centimetres outer LED ring light and 240 LED bulbs set to 100% brightness. A ring was used to negate any shadows by surrounding the date with light on all sides, the flash on the camera provides a strong sudden light to the centre, to emphasize the fleshiness or flabbiness of the date. The dates were put on an elevated platform behind a white background. The distance between the paper and the camera was maintained for all pictures which was 8 cm.

### &ensp;**Content**

- The dataset consists of 1658 high-quality JPG images, each image shows a single date fruit type out of 9 types [Ajwa, Galaxy, Medjool, Meneifi, Nabtat Ali, Rutab, Shaishe, Sokari, Sugaey] native to Saudi Arabia.
